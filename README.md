The pack updates the whole roster of Doom 2/Freedoom with over 650 sound effects of the corresponding `Doom: Eternal` enemies, complete with footsteps and adjusted frequency/volume of barks.

Arachnotron/TechnoSpider shares the firing sounds with the plasma gun, which was also updatedâ€”if that bothers you, either bring your own sound effects for weapons to complement this mod, or delete [these definitions in sndinfo.Arachnotron](https://github.com/awgv/GZDoom-Eternal-enemy-sounds/blob/main/src/sndinfo.Arachnotron#L149-L150).
